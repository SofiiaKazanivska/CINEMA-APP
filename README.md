The application is built on Hibernate and Spring frameworks, using REST, SOLID, DRY principles, Three-Tier architecture:

- Controllers - user interaction with the program: sending requests and receiving responses;
- Services - business logic;
- Data access object (DAO) - interaction of the program with the database.
